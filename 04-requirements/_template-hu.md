HU-SALES-011: Congelación de Category Name en Líneas de Venta
---

Story
As an admin or seller
I want the system to copy and freeze the category name of a product inside the sale item at the exact moment of the purchase
So that historical sales reports remain completely stable and unaffected if the product is later recategorized or the category is renamed.

---

Acceptance criteria
[ ] AC1: Given a valid product belonging to a category, when Sale.AddItem is executed, then the system must synchronously copy the current category.name into the sale_item.category_name column.
[ ] AC2: Given a recorded sale with frozen data, when the category is later renamed in the catalog, then the existing sale_item.category_name must remain unaltered.
[ ] AC3: Given a sale creation attempt, when a product lacks an active or valid category relation, then the system must throw a DomainException and abort the transaction.
